# [Project 2 - Guess the number](https://github.com/ssgalla/python-code-practice/blob/master/basic-guessthenumber.py)
* A simple game made using python and the random module, the module randomly selects a number between 1 and 20.
* Gives the users 6 chances to be able to guess the correct numbe, if it is not correct it will end the game and give the user the option to retry.
* Build a simple interface so user does not have to use the command line to play (currently in progress).

# [Project 3 - Hangman](https://github.com/ssgalla/python-code-practice/blob/master/basic_hangman.py)
* A simple template code made using the word ignore. 
* Gives a working template to be able to add more words to the game for scalibility. 

# [Project 4 - Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://github.com/ssgalla/python-code-practice/blob/master/basic_rockpaperscissors.py)
* A simple game of rock, paper, scissors.
* The computer randomly generates which one it is using the random module and a pre-compiled list. 
* Build a simple interface so user does not have to use the command line to play (currently in progress).

# [Project 5 - Roll the dice](https://github.com/ssgalla/python-code-practice/blob/master/basic_rollthedice.py)
* This small application allows you to roll upto 1 - 6 dices, it is randomly generated usin the random module. 
* The user can use this in co-ordination with a number of other board games should they have the requirement to do so. 
* Build a simple interface so user does not have to use the command line to play (currently in progress). 

# [Project 6 - BS4 Web Scraping Monster Jobs](https://github.com/ssgalla/python-code-practice/blob/master/basic-webscraper-monsterjobs.py)
* This project consists of scraping the website Monster Jobs for software developer jobs in India.
* In this project we use the modules Requests to make a HTML request and Beautiful Soup 4 to parse and look through the HTML data.
* Build a simple interface so user does not have to use the command line to look through data (currently in progress).
* In this project we took the four following steps :-
  * Inspect the HTML structure of our target site using the browsers in-built developer tools.
  * Gain insight in how to decipher the data encoded in URLs.
  * Download the pages HTML content using the requests module.
  * Parse the downloaded HTML content with BS4 to extract required information.

# [Project 7 - Tweepy Python Twitter Bot API Calls Tutorial Document](https://github.com/ssgalla/python-code-practice/blob/master/basic_twitter_tweepy_tutorial.py)
* A basic tutorial with working basic code on how to make various API calls to the twitter website using Tweepy.
* This document will give you the basics on how to make a Twitter Bot using Python, Tweepy Module and JSON Module.

# [Project 8 - Tweepy Twitter API Bots](https://github.com/ssgalla/python-code-practice/tree/master/tweepy_twitter_bot)
* In this project I created three bots:-
  * Follow followers back
  * Favorite retweeting
  * Autoreply 
* This project makes use of multiple modules these being os, logging, time, json and tweepy

# [Project 9 - Pandas and NumPy code snippet booklet](https://github.com/ssgalla/python-code-practice/tree/master/pandas_dataframe)
* A booklet with the most common functions from Pandas and NumPy
* Data Science and General Python Functions

# [Project 10 - Analyzing obesity in England - So who is getting fatter? and What about the future?](https://github.com/ssgalla/python-code-practice/tree/master/analyzing_obesity_uk)
* This project analyses the obesity in England for the year 2004 using official data from gov.co.uk
* For this project we use the pandas, numpy and matplotlib.pyplot modules
* This project made use of the following functions
  * Parsing data
  * Dropping NaN
  * Changing indexes
  * Interpolation
    * Curve Fitting
    * Polynomial Interpolation
* Outcome from analysis :-
  * The data shows via graphs that between the years of 2002/03 til 2012/13 there is a distinct output there is a higher rate of obesity in individuals aged 35-44 than that of under 16 individuals in England
  * After completing Interpolation to gain an estimate of what the future looks like it is clear to see that this will not be the case in the future and the under 16 age group will have much higher rates of obesity than that of the 35-44 age group right now

# [Project 11 - Analyzing confirmed COVID-19 cases in South Korea provinces from a slice of data found on dataset from Kaggle](https://github.com/ssgalla/python-code-practice/tree/master/analyzing_covid_cases_south_korea/analyzing_case_data_city)
* In this project I took a slice of a dataset from Kaggle, to be able to visually display and analyze a group of provinces within South Korea to view how many confirmed cases have appeared
* I used the following modules for this:-
  * Pandas
  * Numpy
  * Matplotlib.pyplot
  
# [Project 12 - Analysis of terrorist plots executed and prevented within the United States of America since the happening on 9/11 until 2016 (currently in progress)]()
* Questions in analysis:-
  * How many terrorist attacks were executed in comparison to how many were prevented?
  * Since 2011 how many victimes have been wounded and/or killed?
  * From the data which plot ideology has been more prominent in carrying out attacks?
  * Looking at the data how many of the suspects were US born citizens compared to non US born citizens?
  * From which area within the USA were most suspects last residency from? 

# [Project 13 - Analyzing air pollution in Seoul, Korea - What were the average levels each year between 2017 - 2019? and have the pollutants reduced in the air between 2017 - 2019? (currently in progress)]()
* This project provides an accurate analysis into the air pollution levels for six pollutants these being
  * SO2
  * NO2
  * CO
  * O3
  * PM10
  * PM2.5
* With the data provided between the years of 2017-2019 we provide a plotted analysis using the average from hourly readings between these years.
