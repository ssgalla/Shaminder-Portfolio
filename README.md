Example python, data science and machine learning portfolio

# [Project 1 - Standard, Trigonometry and Scientific Calculator](https://github.com/ssgalla/python-code-practice/blob/master/basic-calculator.py)
* Create a calculator which provides basic functionality such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
* Add functionality for further equations these being related to trigonometry. Included functions are sine, cosine, tangent, cosecant, secant and cotangent.
* Add further functionality for scientific equations such as powers (currently in progress).
* Build a client facing API so users do not need to use command line (currently in progress).
* Provide interface so user can login or restore session to be able to view previously inserted sums.

# [Project 2 - Guess the number](https://github.com/ssgalla/python-code-practice/blob/master/basic-guessthenumber.py)
* A simple game made using python and the random module, the module randomly selects a number between 1 and 20.
* Gives the users 6 chances to be able to guess the correct numbe, if it is not correct it will end the game and give the user the option to retry.
* Build a simple interface so user does not have to use the command line to play (currently in progress).

# [Project 3 - Hangman](https://github.com/ssgalla/python-code-practice/blob/master/basic_hangman.py)
* A simple template code made using the word ignore. 
* Gives a working template to be able to add more words to the game for scalibility. 

# [Project 4 - Rock, Paper, Scissors](https://github.com/ssgalla/python-code-practice/blob/master/basic_rockpaperscissors.py)
* A simple game of rock, paper, scissors.
* The computer randomly generates which one it is using the random module and a pre-compiled list. 
* Build a simple interface so user does not have to use the command line to play (currently in progress).

# [Project 5 - Roll the dice](https://github.com/ssgalla/python-code-practice/blob/master/basic_rollthedice.py)
* This small application allows you to roll upto 1 - 6 dices, it is randomly generated usin the random module. 
* The user can use this in co-ordination with a number of other board games should they have the requirement to do so. 
* Build a simple interface so user does not have to use the command line to play (currently in progress). 

# [Project 6 - BS4 Web Scraping Monster Jobs](https://github.com/ssgalla/python-code-practice/blob/master/basic-webscraper-monsterjobs.py)
* This project consists of scraping the website Monster Jobs for software developer jobs in India.
* In this project we use the modules Requests to make a HTML request and Beautiful Soup 4 to parse and look through the HTML data.
* Build a simple interface so user does not have to use the command line to look through data (currently in progress).
* In this project we took the four following steps :-
  * Inspect the HTML structure of our target site using the browsers in-built developer tools.
  * Gain insight in how to decipher the data encoded in URLs.
  * Download the pages HTML content using the requests module.
  * Parse the downloaded HTML content with BS4 to extract required information.

# [Project 7 - Tweepy Python Twitter Bot API Calls Tutorial Document](https://github.com/ssgalla/python-code-practice/blob/master/basic_twitter_tweepy_tutorial.py)
* A basic tutorial with working basic code on how to make various API calls to the twitter website using Tweepy.
* This document will give you the basics on how to make a Twitter Bot using Python, Tweepy Module and JSON Module.

# [Project 8 - Tweepy Twitter API Bots](https://github.com/ssgalla/python-code-practice/tree/master/tweepy_twitter_bot)
* In this project I created three bots:-
  * Follow followers back
  * Favorite retweeting
  * Autoreply 
* This project makes use of multiple modules these being os, logging, time, json and tweepy

# [Project 9 - Pandas and NumPy code snippet booklet](https://github.com/ssgalla/python-code-practice/tree/master/pandas_dataframe)
